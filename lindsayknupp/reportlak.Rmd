## Dataset

Our data was collected from [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services](https://data.cms.gov/provider-compliance/cost-report/hospital-provider-cost-report) on April 03, 2024. It features information about hospitals through annual cost reports in $2020$. We were interested in understanding how certain characteristics of hospitals like location, number of full time equivalent employees, or number of beds, for example, affected the hospitals' total operating costs. To perform qualitative analyses, we categorized each hospital as above or below the median. 

While the data is roughly annual, certain hospitals reported for different fiscal year lengths. To normalize, we divided some of our variables by the length of their cost reporting period to obtain daily estimates like average number of inpatients per day or average salary expense per day. Variables that are reported as "averages per day" are denoted with the word "average" in the predictor table below. Some hospitals were listed multiple times with distinct reporting periods. We learned that this could correspond to a change in control of the hospital. For example, the hospital could have been sold and transitioned from a voluntary to a governmental hospital. Duplicate hospitals were left in the dataset and a dummy variable, `duplicate` was added to indicate its status.  

There were $13$ different categories of control ranging from "Voluntary Non-Profit-Church" to "Governmental-Federal". To reduce our number of categories, we re-binned this variable to only include the broad categories: "Voluntary", "Proprietary", and "Governmental". We followed a similar procedure for the $12$ different categories of provider type ranging from "Children" to "Cancer" to "General Long Term". In this case, we re-binned provider type to only distinguish between "General" and "Specialized" care. We classified "General Short Term", "General Long Term", and "Religious Non-Medical Health Care Institution" as "General" care and classified "Cancer", "Psychiatric", "Rehabilitation",
"Children", "Reserved for Future Use", "Other", "Extended Neoplastic Disease Care", "Indian Health Services", and "Rural Emergency Hospital" as "Specialized" care. 

To improve accuracy on methods like Lasso regression, we scaled our numerical variables using the `scale()` function which centered and scaled our data appropriately. The following table includes the ranges of the predictors and response before they were re-scaled.

## Simulation Study 

We were interested in understanding how our data affected the optimal choice of $k$ in the $k$ -nearest neighbors algorithm. We already experienced some variability when running our model through on different computers. Therefore, we wanted to see if more simulated datasets would produce the same variablility. 

To replicate our $13$ predictors and $2$ response variables, we used a package called `faux` to simulate our numerical predictors from a multivariate normal distribution. 

We used a standard normal distribution to replicate our $13$ predictors. 

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

results = read_csv("~/hospital-costs/lindsayknupp/sim_study_results.csv")

ggplot(results) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=k),bins=15) +
  ggtitle("Optimal k over 200 datasets") +
  xlab("k") + 
  ylab("count")

ggplot(results) +
  geom_point(aes(x=k,y=error)) + 
  ggtitle("Error rates vs optimal k")

ggplot(results) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x=var),bins=15)

ggplot(results) +
  geom_point(aes(x=k,y=var)) +
  ggtitle("Error variance vs optimal k")

```
